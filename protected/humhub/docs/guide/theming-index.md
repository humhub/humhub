Theming
=======

With **HumHub** you can easily create your own themes. Regardless of whether you want to build a complete new looking interface or you only want to do some small changes to fit the platform better to your needs. **HumHub** gives you the options you need. 

``Note:`` If you want to update an existing theme to a newer version of HumHub, please read the [Theming Migration Guide](migrate.md).

### What you need to know about theming in HumHub
1. **HumHub** was build within the **yiiframework** (<http://www.yiiframework.com>). This framework implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. If this is new for you, please visit <http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-README.html> for more information.

2. The interface of **HumHub** is using the actually **Twitter Bootstrap Framework** (<http://www.getbootstrap.com>) to building the interface.

3. If you created a new theme you have to put it to the **/themes** folder in your HumHub directory. You can switch to the new theme through your account menu **Administration > Design > Theme**.

## Structure of theme folders

The principle of theming in **HumHub** is overwriting. To build a new theme, you have to create a new folder with the name of your new theme (for example: "mytheme") inside the "themes" folder in application root.

**The following listing shows you the folder structure for a theme:**

    /mytheme/                       - My Theme Name
        /css/                       - Your theme css files (optional)
        /js/                        - Additional javascript files (optional)
        /font/                      - Additional fonts (optional)
        /img/                       - Images (optional)         
        /views/                     - Overwritten Views
            /moduleId/              - Id of Module (module_core Id, module Id, or base controller id)
                /controllerId/      - Id of Controller
                    index.php       - Overwritten View File
                /widgets/           - Links to /someModule/widgets/views/
                    someWidget.php  - Overwritten widget view
            /widgets/                - Links to /protected/widget/views

``Note: ``  There is an difference between yiiÂ´s normal widget theme handling!

## Edit CSS
If you want to create a new theme or just want to change some styles, we recommend to dublicate the standard HumHub theme (duplicate and rename the folder) and make your changes there. Never edit the standard HumHub theme directly, because all changes there will be override by an update.

At the **/themes/yourtheme/css/** folder you will find the compressed **theme.css** and a **theme.less** file. The easiest way is to edit the *.less file and compile then the css file.

At the first lines in the **theme.less** file you will find the color variables. If you just want to change the colors to adapt HumHub to your CI, simple change the color codes.

If you want to build modules, you will also find there color classes for font, border and background colors of every bootstrap style like ``colorDefault``, ``backgroundDefault`` and ``borderDefault``. Use these color classes at the html elements in your module to alway adobt the colors from the currently activated theme.




## Custom theme files
To load additional **CSS** or **JavaScript** files to your theme, add them to the **head.php** in

    /themes/mytheme/views/layouts/


---

## Custom views
To modify a view, you have to copy the original **view** from the **protected/humhub/***  folder into your **theme** folder. Please take care to observe the themes folder structure above.

If your theme is activiated, **HumHub** automatically looks at first inside the theme folder. If there was no view found, he will load the original one.
