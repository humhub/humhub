Database and Models
=================

This guide describes how to setup and update your modules database scheme. All database installation and update scripts will reside in
your modules `migration` directory.

## Conventions

- **prefix** your tables with the module id. e.g. `example_foo`
- **singular** table names
- use **underscorce** in fieldnames andattributes e.g. `user_id`

## Initial Migration

Once you've a concept of your database scheme ready and want to start prototyping, you'll need to create an initial [migration](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/db-migrations#creating-migrations).

The following command executed in the `protected` directory will create a new migration into the `protected/humhub/migrations` folder:

```
php yii migrate/create mymodule_inital
```

which resembles the following grunt command executed within the `root` of your installation:

```
grunt migrate-create --name=mymodule_inital
```

Just copy the resulting migration from the `protected/humhub/migrations` into your modules `migration` folder and add your scheme setup.
Please refer to the [Yii Migration Guide](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/db-migrations#creating-migrations) for more information about
how to use the `Migration` guide.

Your table names should be prefixed with your unique module id like `mymodule_entry`.

> Info: The [[humhub\components\Migration]] class provides some additional helper functions.

> Tip: Since a `Migration::safeUp()` uses transactions you should consider splitting your migration files into multiple migrations.

> Note: Only data manipulation queries can be rolled back in case a migration script fails.

## Scheme Updates

In order to provide scheme updates for new versions, just follow the same steps as in the [Initial Migration](#initial-migration) section.

You can manually execute new migrations by the following commands:

```
php yii migrate/up --includeModuleMigrations=1
```

or by grunt 

```
grunt migrate-up
```

Missing migrations are also executed when accessing `Administration -> Information -> Database`.

## Uninstall Migration

Your module should also privde an `uninstall.php` file.
The uninstall migration is by default executed within your `Module::disable()` logic method and should look like:

```
use yii\db\Migration;

class uninstall extends Migration
{

    public function up()
    {
        $this->dropTable('mymodule_entry');
        $this->dropTable('mymodule_entry_user');
    }

    public function down()
    {
        echo "uninstall does not support migration down.\n";
        return false;
    }

}
```

## Integrity Check

The integrity check is a command which validates and if necessary repairs the application database.

If you want to add own checking methods for your module to it, you can intercept the [[humhub\commands\IntegrityController::EVENT_ON_RUN]] event.

Example callback implementation:

```php
public static function onIntegrityCheck($event)
{
    $integrityController = $event->sender;
    $integrityController->showTestHeadline("Polls Module - Answers (" . PollAnswer::find()->count() . " entries)");

    foreach (PollAnswer::find()->joinWith('poll')->all() as $answer) {
        if ($answer->poll === null) {
            if ($integrityController->showFix("Deleting poll answer id " . $answer->id . " without existing poll!")) {
                $answer->delete();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## ActiveRecord

HumHub uses Yii's [ActiveRecords](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-db-active-record.html) as database access layer.
