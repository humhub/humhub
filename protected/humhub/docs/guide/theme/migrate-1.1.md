# Theme Migration to HumHub 1.1

- Make sure to update your themed less file with the latest version.
In the upcoming 1.2.x releases we'll split the 'theme' less file into multiple files, to simplify this process.

- There were also many view file updates this release, please check changes (e.g. diff) of your themed versions.
We are constantly reducing view complexity to ease this process.

**Important changed views:**

- Logins (Standalone / Modal)
- Registration
- Main Layout
