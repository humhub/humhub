# Getting Started

The **HumHub** default themes can be used out of the box to create clean and professional looking social networks. 
However, you may wish to provide your own styling that matches your personal design aesthetic or that of an existing enterprise design.

**HumHub** provides two different approaches to change the look and feel:

## Stylesheets (CSS/LESS)

Modify the default stylesheets (based on CSS and LESS) to adjust colors, fonts or styles of used elements.

## Adjust View Files

Overwrite the default templates used in **HumHub** to modify elements, adjust positions, remove existing elements or also add new elements.
