          This is a game where you prompt your AI teammate to guess a word
          without saying the forbidden words. Because it uses a generative
          language model, you can give it just about any clue and it will use
          that clue to generate new guesses. Itâ€™s a simple demo of how
          developers can use the Google Generative Language API to build AI apps
          like conversation-driven games.
