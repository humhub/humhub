/**
 * Define or overwrite your theme variables here.
 *
 * Use the `baseTheme` variable to define the parent theme. E.g.:
 * $baseTheme: "HumHub";
 *
 * Check for @humhub/static/scss/variables.scss file for all available variables.
 *
 * You can also access your variables within your view files by calling Yii::$app->view->theme->variable('myVariable');
 *
 * You can disable the import of HumHub theme components by using variables of the format @prev-{component}.
 * This will prevent comment.scss component from being imported.
 * E.g.:
 * @prev-comment: true;
