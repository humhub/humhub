// Libraries Inclusions
// Description: Import the libraries you want to use and the (less) operator will import them inline vs. referencing them within the output document

// We are using Bootstrap's LESS files. You can update what you want to keep, or discard within the following document
// FIXME: verify this already imported as a core HumHub style component
// @import "../../lib/bootstrap/less/bootstrap";

// If you want to use the default Bootstrap Theme (http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme), uncomment this line
// @import "../../lib/bootstrap/less/theme";

// Font Awesome included as LESS
// FIXME: Confirm this is already imported as a core HumHub style component
// @import "../../lib/font-awesome/less/font-awesome";
