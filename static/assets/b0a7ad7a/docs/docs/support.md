Depending on the nature of your problem there are a few possible ways of getting help with your problem.

###Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow has an active community answering questions on both the [bluebird](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird) and [promise](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/promise) tags. If you are unfamiliar with Stack Overflow, do review [the asking guidelines](http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking) before asking a new question there.

###Google Groups mailing list

The [bluebird-js@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bluebird-js) mailing list is the best place to ask any question that cannot be easily fit in the stack overflow question format.

###IRC

You can usually get fast answers on the freenode.net channels [#bluebird](irc://chat.freenode.net/bluebird) and [#promises](irc://chat.freenode.net/promises).

###Gitter

If you are not comfortable using IRC you can also join the [bluebird gitter chat](https://gitter.im/petkaantonov/bluebird)

###Github issue tracker

If you feel that your problem is caused by a bug or a missing feature that should be added, you should use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues/) to report it. However in any other case the issue tracker is not the appropriate channel.
