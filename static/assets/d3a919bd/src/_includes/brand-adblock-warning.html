Apparently, Adblock Plus can remove Font Awesome brand icons with their "Remove Social
Media Buttons" setting. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please
<a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs" class="alert-link">report an issue with Adblock Plus</a> if you believe this to be
an error. To work around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.
